> üö® **Note:** This is an update to the original blog post posted [here](/blog/diy-doorbell-chime-for-hikvision-isapi-with-a-raspberry-pi-pico/).

**This blog post talks about integrating [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) functionality to the RPI Pico doorbell chime. üì≤üîî**

I've had this on my to-do list for a while: "Integrate Pushover functionality." üìù

## Firmware update Hikvision DS-KV6113-WPE1(B) üîÑ

The first step I had to do was upgrade the firmware on my Hikvision DS-KV6113-WPE1(B) doorbell to `V2.2.53_230918`. This version for (B) models of doorbell can be [downloaded here](https://www.hikvisioneurope.com/eu/portal/?dir=portal/Technical%20Materials/07%20%20Video%20Intercom/00%20%20Product%20Firmware/01%20Door%20Station%20%28KD%20KV%20KB%29/KV%20Series/KV8413%20KV8213%20KV8113%20KV6113%20KV6103%20%28B%20Version%29/V2.2.53_Build%20230918%20Protocol%202.0). ‚¨áÔ∏è

This update is required to gain access to the ISAPI endpoint `/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/101/picture` which allows for an image capture. In this project, this sends an image capture of the doorbell via a Base64 encoded attachment to Pushover. üì∏

Prior to this version, I was using firmware `V2.2.53_220816` which did not have this endpoint available.

## Testing the capture endpoint üß™

This new endpoint can be tested via curl, try this command:

```
curl -i --digest -u admin:YOUR_PASSWORD "http://YOUR_IP/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/101/picture" >> example.txt
```

You should see a response in `example.txt`. ‚úÖ

## Enabling Pushover ‚öôÔ∏è

In the updated project code on Github: [https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-hikvision-isapi-doorbell-chime](https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-hikvision-isapi-doorbell-chime)

Configure your details in `src/main.py`. The new configuration details for Pushover you should edit are:

```
# Pushover Message API Configuration
use_pushover=False                                  # Enable/Disable Pushover functionality
pushover_token=""                                   # The Pushover APP token - Register on https://pushover.net/ to generate a token
pushover_user=""                                    # The Pushover APP user or group key - Configure this on https://pushover.net/
pushover_message="Someone is at your door!"         # Message for the doorbell message
```

* `use_pushover`: Allows you to enable or disable Pushover. Set this to `True` ‚úÖ
* `pushover_token`: This is your APP token, created at [https://pushover.net/apps/build](https://pushover.net/apps/build). üîë
* `pushover_user`: This is your User Key token, displayed at the top right of [https://pushover.net/](https://pushover.net/). Alternatively, you can use a 'User Group' token, which you can set up [here](https://pushover.net/groups/build). üë•
* `pushover_message`: Edit this message if you wish. This is the message that is displayed in the Pushover notification sent to your device. üì®

## Capturing and sending the image üñºÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüì≤

### imageCaputure() üè∑Ô∏è

Take a look at the `imageCaputure()` function between lines `#520` and `#634`. [Link to code](https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-hikvision-isapi-doorbell-chime/blob/71f188c5d791c56ca951182d19a6324e4ede7fa2/src/main.py#L520-L634).

The usual digest authentication takes place, then the request to the `/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/101/picture` happens on line `#602`.

The return of the body response is captured by the `data` variable on line `#629`, where it is encoded to Base64 and UTF-8 decoded:

```
# Return the base64 encoded image
data = base64.b64encode(_body.content).decode('utf-8')
```

The `imageCaputure()` function returns the `data` variable for use later when being sent via Pushover.

### sendPushoverMessage() üöÄ

This function handles sending the messages to [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). You can view this between lines `#639` and `#686`. [Link to code](https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-hikvision-isapi-doorbell-chime/blob/71f188c5d791c56ca951182d19a6324e4ede7fa2/src/main.py#L639-L686).

The Base64 encoded data returned from `imageCaputure()` is decoded into bytes (between lines `#649` and `#649`):

```
# Decode base64 to bytes
if attachment_base64:
    image_bytes = ubinascii.a2b_base64(attachment_base64)
else:
    image_bytes = b''
```

It is used to build up a multipart form body. This content is then sent to Pushover (between lines `#657` and `#678`):

```
# Build multipart body
body = (
    f'--{boundary}\r\n'
    f'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="token"\r\n\r\n{pushover_token}\r\n'
    f'--{boundary}\r\n'
    f'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user"\r\n\r\n{pushover_user}\r\n'
    f'--{boundary}\r\n'
    f'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="message"\r\n\r\n{message}\r\n'
).encode('utf-8')

if image_bytes:
    body += (
        f'--{boundary}\r\n'
        f'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="attachment"; filename="image.jpg"\r\n'
        f'Content-Type: {attachment_type}\r\n\r\n'
    ).encode('utf-8') + image_bytes + f'\r\n'.encode('utf-8')

body += f'--{boundary}--\r\n'.encode('utf-8')

# Send the request
import urequests as requests
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=body)
```
