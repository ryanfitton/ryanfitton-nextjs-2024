summary: 'How I built a garage door opener with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and 3V relay hat.'
---


I have an electric garage door that can be opened either with a keyfob or by manually pressing a button on the motor unit housing. This setup works well, but if you don‚Äôt have the keyfob with you or need to open the door remotely, you‚Äôre out of luck.

I had a spare Raspberry Pi Pico W (1st Gen) from a previous project that I upgraded with a Pico W 2. I thought I could repurpose the original Pico to power a relay connected to the garage door motor‚Äôs accessory port pins. Connecting these pins completes a circuit, signaling the motor to open or close the garage door. A relay works perfectly here, requiring only a brief 0.5-second pulse to trigger the motor.


## Hardware

To begin, I researched pre-made relay hats. I didn‚Äôt need anything large, as the garage door motor only required a small (12V) voltage to bridge the two pins. I found the [**3V Relay Hat** by SB Components](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/pico-dual-channel-relay-hat), which fit my needs perfectly. It includes two relays powered directly by the 3V from the Pico‚Äôs GPIO pins. Although I only needed one relay, the second can be disabled or used as a spare.

Once the hat arrived, I tested the relays using the demo code provided by SB Components: [Relay Hat Test Code](https://github.com/sbcshop/Pico-3V-Relay-HAT/blob/main/test.py). Each relay clicked on and off correctly, confirming the setup was functional.

I'm using a 1st Gen Pico W for this project, but the 2nd Gen version also works. Just make sure your Pico has Wi-Fi capability.

## Web Server

I knew a basic web server could run on the Pico from past experience, but I came across the [**Phew** web server](https://github.com/pimoroni/phew) by [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/). With the help of a template project from [Simon Prickett](https://github.com/simonprickett/pimoroni-phew-template-demo), I was able to host simple HTML and CSS.

This project uses **MicroPython**, which I'm familiar with from previous work, such as my [DIY doorbell project](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/diy-doorbell-chime-for-hikvision-isapi-with-a-raspberry-pi-pico/). I'm running MicroPython version `v1.25.0` (2025-04-15). You can download the firmware here:

- [Pico W](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/)
- [Pico W 2](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO2_W/)

**Phew** offers built-in templating, allowing for HTML segmentation (header, footer, etc.), external CSS/JS linking, and variable passing between templates.

For styling, I used [**Tailwind CSS v4.1**](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-1), along with additional JS functionality using [**Add to Homescreen v3.3**](https://github.com/philfung/add-to-homescreen). Images are hosted externally or encoded in Base64‚Äîfor example, I used Base64 for favicons.

To open the garage door, an Ajax request is sent to the `/api/relay` endpoint with a relay name and a PIN for added security. Although the server is only accessible within my home network, this helps prevent accidental button presses or unauthorized usage.

## Configuration

All configuration options are defined in the `config.py` file:

```python
WIFI_SSID = "YOUR WIFI NETWORK NAME"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "YOUR WIFI NETWORK PASSWORD"

PIN = 1234  # PIN for web button activation
ENABLE_RELAY_1 = True
ENABLE_RELAY_2 = True

RELAY_1_TIME_BUTTON_DISABLED = 12000  # ms delay before next click allowed
RELAY_2_TIME_BUTTON_DISABLED = 12000

RELAY_1_TIME_BETWEEN = 0.5  # seconds between on > off
RELAY_2_TIME_BETWEEN = 0.5

RELAY_1_PIN = 6  # GPIO pin
RELAY_2_PIN = 7

# UI Theme settings
SITE_TITLE = "Garage Door Opener"
SITE_RELAY_1_BTN_LABEL = "Open/Close Relay 1"
SITE_RELAY_2_BTN_LABEL = "Open/Close Relay 2"
SITE_COPYRIGHT_YEAR = "2025"
SITE_VERSION = "1.0.0"
SITE_FOOTER_LINKS = [
    {
        "text": "Github",
        "href": "https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-garage-door-opener"
    },
    {
        "text": "About this project",
        "href": "https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/raspberry-pi-pico-garage-door-opener"
    }
]
```

### Key Settings

- `PIN`: Security pin used to authorize button presses via the web interface.
- `ENABLE_RELAY_1` and `ENABLE_RELAY_2`: Toggle each relay‚Äôs functionality (`True` or `False`).
- `RELAY_1_TIME_BUTTON_DISABLED` / `RELAY_2_TIME_BUTTON_DISABLED`: Time in milliseconds the button is disabled after being pressed (prevents repeated activations).
- `RELAY_1_TIME_BETWEEN` / `RELAY_2_TIME_BETWEEN`: Time in seconds between turning the relay on and off.


## Using This Code

Follow the installation instructions from the project README:  
üëâ [GitHub - rpi-pico-garage-door-opener](https://github.com/ryanfitton/rpi-pico-garage-door-opener?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

1. Install the MicroPython firmware (download it from [here](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/)).
2. Edit your `src/config.py` file with your details.
3. Copy all project files to the Pico.

I use [**Thonny**](https://thonny.org/) to upload and manage files.


## Considerations

This code was written to the best of my abilities, but it may contain bugs or issues. Feel free to submit pull requests or improvements.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not expose the web server to the public internet.**  
I run mine exclusively on a local network and use a VPN for remote access when needed.
