summary: 'Generating reports with the MDN (Mozilla) HTTP Observatory tool.'

I've recently discovered a tool from Mozilla that generates a best-practices report for implementing HTTP headers.  

Link: [MDN HTTP Observatory](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory)  

While I've used Google PageSpeed before, the MDN HTTP Observatory provides detailed guidance on configuring your web server to serve up-to-date HTTP headers.  

After using this tool, I made several improvements to my site. Since my site runs on Cloudflare, I had to set up 'Header Response' rules in Cloudflare. After implementing these changes, my score improved to a 'B' with a score of 75/100 significantly better than before.  

I came across this tool while exploring the excellent [National Grid: Live](https://grid.iamkate.com/) site by Kate and reading her post on '[Free Content](https://iamkate.com/ideas/free-content/)'.
