summary: 'Why I use private Git repos with Markdown files for documentation.'
---

I maintain documentation for my home network setup, websites, and other technical aspects.

I originally used Microsoft Word, then switched to LibreOffice, and more recently, Google Docs. However, I wanted a solution that would make it easy to track version changes, edit documentation across different platforms, and remain device-agnostic.

By chance, I came across the idea of using Git for this purpose and realized it offered everything I needed. I keep my repository private, and since GitHub automatically renders `README.md` files, the content is easily readable in a web browser.

Git provides effortless rollbacks and retains a complete file history for reference when needed.

For an even more advanced setup, you could self-host a [Read the Docs](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org) site or possibly host the documentation on GitHub Pages. However, a private GitHub Pages instance requires a premium GitHub account, which Iâ€™m not looking to pay for at the moment. For now, a private repository with `.md` files meets my needs perfectly.
